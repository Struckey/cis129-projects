# Prints a short story about a shieldbug
print ("As winter quickly approaches and endless cold days are near.")
print ("The shield bug slowly inches up the wall pleased with himself for finding the one breech to enter the warmth of the home")
print ("That is until he met the bristles of a broom wielded by a girl with vengeance in her eyes.")
print ("For one day her brother was traumatized by another who had flown into his mouth causing him to choke.")
print ("Since that day shield bugs were no longer trusted in the home and must be exterminated at first sighting.")
print ("The End.")
